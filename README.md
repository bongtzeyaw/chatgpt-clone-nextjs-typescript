# chatgpt-clone-nextjs-typescript
A NextJS project that clones ChatGPT interface and calls OpenAI chat/completions API. We also experiment using typescript to experience the type safety property.
Similar to previous project, the project is mainly built on React and Node and uses OpenAI API. For the styling, we also experiment using TailWindCSS.

Open terminal/bash in this repo and enter below commands to start the application
$ npm run dev
Your application should run on port 3000 with the development environment configuration, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:3000
